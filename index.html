        <p>
        I am currently a senior at the University of Iowa, triple majoring in marketing, business analytics and information systems, and political science. I am in both the

          College of Liberal Arts and Sciences
          </a>  at Iowa.
        My hometown is West Des Moines, Iowa and went to Valley High School. Although I absolutely love all things Iowa (after spending the last 22 years of my life here),
        I am so excited to explore new places after graduation. My preferred location after graduation is currently Chicago, Illinois and I am excited to continue exploring opportunities there.

            I've held three internships during the summers between my freshman, sophomore, and junior years. My first internship was at the World Food Prize Foundation in Des Moines, Iowa. I was the Communications and Public Relations Intern.
            The next summer, I interned at the Iowa Secretary of State's Office in the beautiful Iowa State Capitol in Des Moines, Iowa as their Marketing Intern. Finally, last summer, I interned at Sammons Financial Group in West Des Moines, Iowa. As their Marketing Communications Intern, I got to 
            work on fascinating marketing and analytics projects. These varied experiences have allowed me to grow in my skills outside of the classroom. I cannot wait to continue learning throughout the rest of my undergraduate career and beyond!
